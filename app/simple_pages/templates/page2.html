            <h3>What is Docker?</h3>
            <p>Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to
                separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker,
                you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage
                of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly
                reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
            </p>
            <h5>Container</h5>
            <p>
                A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the
                application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container
                image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to
                run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
            <p>
                Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers - images become
                containers when they run on Docker Engine. Available for both Linux and Windows-based applications,
                containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. Containers isolate
                software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance
                between development and staging.
            </p>

            </p>
            <h5>Docker Images</h5>
            </p> A Docker image is a read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a container
            that can run on the Docker platform. It provides a convenient way to ackage up applications and
            preconfigured server environments, which you can use for your own private use or share publicly with other
            Docker users. Docker images are also the starting point for anyone using Docker for the first time.
            </p>

            <h4>Docker Compose</h4>
            <p>
                Docker containers are used for running applications in an isolated environment. It’s quite common
                nowadays to see application deployments done in Docker for the numerous benefits it brings. However,
                it’s often not as simple as just running a single container. Usually you may have many containers coming
                together to act as one cohesive service made up of many moving parts.</p>


            <p> Managing all of these at deployment time is messy, so to clean it up, Docker provides Docker Compose, a
                configuration tool used for running multiple containers at once. You can define all of the configuration
                in one YAML file, and then start all the containers with one command.</p>

            <p> Rather than having all your services in one big container, Docker Compose allows you to split them up
                into individually manageable containers. This is both better for building and deployment, as you can
                manage all of them in separate codebases, and don’t need to manually start each individual container.
            </p>

            <ul><h5>Using Docker Compose is a three step process:</h5>
                <li>Build the component images using their Dockerfiles, or pull them from a registry.</li>
                <li>Define all of the component services in a docker-compose.yml file.</li>
                <li>Run all of them together using the docker-compose CLI.</li>
            </ul>

                    <h7>How to start Docker project</h7>
                    <p><code>$ docker compose up --build </code></p>
                </dt>
                <dd>- This builds your entire container based on your YAML file, and the things you have specified.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    <h7>How to check logs</h7>
                    <p><code>$ docker-compose logs -f </code></p>
                </dt>
                <dd>- You’ll see the logs from each of the services interleaved into a single stream. This is incredibly
                    useful when you want to watch for timing-related issues.
